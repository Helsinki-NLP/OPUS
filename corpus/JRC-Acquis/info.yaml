description: >
  JRC-Acquis is a collection of legislative text of the European Union and currently comprises selected texts written between the 1950s and now.
  Source: https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/language-technologies/jrc-acquis</br>
  The version at OPUS is based on the paragraph-aligned corpus provided by JRC (aligned using hunalign) but adds also sentence boundary markup and sentence alignment for all sentence pairs. The format is also converted to be compatible with OPUS but contains the same information otherwise (content and metadata).
