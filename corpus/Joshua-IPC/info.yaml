description: >
  This directory contains data sets for Bengali, Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. Each data set was created by taking around 100 Indian-language Wikipedia pages and obtaining four independent translations of each of the sentences in those documents.</br>
  The procedure used to create them, along with descriptions of initial experiments, is described in: <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W12-3152" target="_blank">Constructing Parallel Corpora for Six Indian Languages via Crowdsourcing</a>. 2012. Matt Post, Chris Callison-Burch, and Miles Osborne. Proceedings of the NAACL Workshop for Statistical Machine Translation (WMT).
