This dataset is compiled from TED talk subtitles and distributed through phontron.com. The package here includes the training data only (development and test data are not included in this package). The transcripts have been translated by a global community of volunteers to more than 100 languages. The parallel corpus and the code fopr cerating it is available from https://www.ted.com/participate/translate
Note that this corpus is tokenized in its original form. For this package we applied automatic de-tokenization using the moses tools. This is not perfect and may miss some de-tokenization steps.
