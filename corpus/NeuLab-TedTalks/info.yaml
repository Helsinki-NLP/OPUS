  This dataset is compiled from TED talk subtitles and distributed through <a href="http://phontron.com/data/ted_talks.tar.gz" target="_blank"> phontron.com</a>. The package here includes the training data only (development and test data are not included in this package). The transcripts have been <a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/translate" target="_blank">translated by a global community of volunteers</a> to more than 100 languages. The parallel corpus and the code fopr cerating it is available from https://www.ted.com/participate/translate </br>
  Note that this corpus is tokenized in its original form. For this package we applied automatic de-tokenization using the moses tools. This is not perfect and may miss some de-tokenization steps.
