The MaCoCu project collected monolingual and parallel data from the Internet, especially for under-resourced languages and DSI-specific data. Parallel texts have been extracted using the bitextor toolbox. This release is further processed for making it a multi-parallel corpus by pivoting via English. Here we provide the additional language pairs that came out of pivoting. The bitexts for English are the same as the ones in the original MaCoCu release.
