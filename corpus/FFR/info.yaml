description: >
  FFR Dataset is an ongoing project to collect, clean and store corpora of Fon and French sentences for machine translation from Fon-French. Fon (also called Fongbe) is an African-indigenous language spoken mostly in Benin, by about 1.7 million people. As training data is crucial to the high performance of a machine learning model, the aim of this project is to compile the largest set of training corpora for the research and design of translation and NLP models involving Fon. </br>
