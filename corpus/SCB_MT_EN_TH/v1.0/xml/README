The AI Research Institute of Thailand (AIResearch), with the collaboration between Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology (VISTEC) and Digital Economy Promotion Agency (depa), published this open English-Thai machine translation dataset, with the sponsorship from Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), namely scb-mt-en-th-2020. The dataset contains parallel sentences from various sources such as task-based conversation, organization websites, Wikipedia articles, and government documents. To obtain parallel sentences, they hired professional and crowdsourced translators and build a module to automatically align parallel sentence pairs from documents, articles, and web pages.
