  Parallel corpora from Web Crawls collected in the <a href="http://paracrawl.eu/" target="_blank">ParaCrawl project</a> and further processed for making it a multi-parallel corpus by pivoting via English. Here we only provide the additional language pairs that came out of pivoting. The bitexts for English are available from the ParaCrawl release.
