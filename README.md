This directory contains information about the released parallel corpora and derived data
sets in OPUS, the open collection of parallel corpora. Each sub-directory in `corpus/`
corresponds to one specific resource with released versions and data sets
according to the following format:


~~~
corpus/name/vX ........... corpus release with version <vX>
corpus/name/vX/raw ....... untokenized XML files
corpus/name/vX/xml ....... tokenized XML files (possibly more annotation)
~~~

There are various data files that are derived from the core data sets.

~~~
corpus/name/vX/moses ..... plain text files for each bitext (Moses format)
corpus/name/vX/tmx ....... translation memory exchange format for each bitext
corpus/name/vX/parsed .... parsed corpora in XML (not all data sets are parsed)
corpus/name/vX/dic ....... a rough dictionary extracted from word alignment
corpus/name/vX/mono ...... monolingual plain text files for each language
corpus/name/vX/freq ...... token frequency lists
corpus/name/vX/smt ....... word alignments and extracted phrase translation tables
~~~
